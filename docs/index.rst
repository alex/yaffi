Welcome to Yaffi
================

Yaffi stands for Yet Another Foreign Function Interface. It's a library
designed to do two things:

* Interface with existing C (and other binary) libraries.
* Manipulate raw memory.

It's designed to correct a number of defects in ``ctypes`` (which has been a
part of the Python standard library since 2.5), and expose a nicer API.

.. note::

    Everything about how ``yaffi`` works is based on a theoretical design, no
    code exists for it yet.
